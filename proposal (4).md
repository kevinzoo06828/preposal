# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Goat Game
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A video game where the user is able to control a goat.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My project will be a video game where the user controls a goat, similar to goat simulator. The user gains points for collecting objects and jumping over rocks, hills and platforms. The user loses points for bumping into objects and falling from elevated surfaces. The user needs to have had a certain number of points at the end of the game to win.

The game will feature the way a goat moves through obstacles to visualize how goats move in real life. It will be created using python, and music and sound effects will be added to make the game engaging.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I am not planning to combing 1051's ginal project with another course's final project.
TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
I am not planning to collabarate with any classmates.
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
An animated goat character tht the player can move through the obstacle with controls for movement, collecting and jumping objects.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Multiple levels and areas for the goat to explore, and music and sound effects added in the background.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A complete interactive game featuring multiple levels, and objects that respond when the goats hit them. There will also be detailed art, music and a final results screen when the game ends.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to use pygame and I will learn how to create a video game using python, while including all the features of the game. I will also learn how to add soundtracks and music in the background to make the game fun and enjoyable for the user to play.
