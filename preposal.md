# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I would like to create a video game where the user is able to control a goat and go through a field. The goat is able to jump through objects such as rocks, logs and fences, and the idea of the game is similar to Goat Simulator. The goat earns points by collecting food items like leaves or hay and climbing and jumping on elevated surfaces such as rocks and platforms. If the goat trips and falls off or breaks an object, you lose, and the game is over.
